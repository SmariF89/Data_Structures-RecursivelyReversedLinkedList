# Data_Structures-RecursivelyReversedLinkedList
This repo contains two small projects which deal with recursion. The titular linked list which has a reverse function which recursively reverses the list and a prefix parser which recursively parses a stream of symbols.

The singly linked list recursively reverses its pointer "directions" in order to reverse its order.

The prefix parser deals with strings of mathematical symbols (+-\*/) and integers which are written in Polish notation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation). It recursively parses the strings and calculates a final outcome.

The main.cpp and test.txt files contain tests for the prefix parser.
